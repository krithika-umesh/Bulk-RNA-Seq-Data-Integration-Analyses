# Analysis of brain data of mice exposed to microgravity/spaceflight
The repository contains code for integrating two bulk RNA‑seq datasets and performing downstream analysis. The goal of this work is to identify candidate biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease in mouse models exposed to microgravity.

# Dataset information
The datasets used are OSD-202 and OSD-457 from the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR). The samples come from two mouse brain regions—mid/hindbrain and forebrain (cerebrum)—collected after one month of simulated microgravity or spaceflight exposure. Control groups from both datasets were integrated and analyzed to explore candidate Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers.
