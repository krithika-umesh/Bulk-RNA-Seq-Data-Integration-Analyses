Analysis of brain data of mice exposed to microgravity/spaceflight
The repository contains code for integrating 2 bulk RNA seq datasets. The datasets are from 2 parts of brain i.e. mid & hind brain and Forebrain (cerebrum) and the data is collected after 1 month of simulated microgravity/spaceflight.
